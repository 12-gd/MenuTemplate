# MenuTemplate

Set the game instance (Content/MenuTemplate/BP/BP_GameInstance) in the project settings/Maps and modes.

I think it was added to the ignore list and idk how to remove it without making a new repository. If anyone knows how just let me know.

If you have any questions please ask. This is provided as is and everything in it should be free. I think this is a good starting point.
